# Clocks



The system requires two clocks, 10MHz and 1PPS (pulse per second). The stability between Alice and Bob should be around 100ps on a timescales of around 100us. This is to ensure Bob can measure the pulses with a 100ps precision. Absolute timing stability is not important.

## WR Switch

The White Rabbit Switch is an ethernet switch with SFP modules that distributes the clock over ethernet as well. Using such a switch a single optical channel is sufficient on the classical network.

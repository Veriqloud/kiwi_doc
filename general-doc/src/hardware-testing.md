# Hardware Testing


Just some guidelines for hardware testing. 

Labequipment you might need:

- Oscilloscope with sufficient bandwidth (e.g. Siglent SDS5034X 4Ch 350MHz 5GSa/s; or better)
- Voltmeter
- Optical powermeter
- analogue and logical probes for the oscilloscope
- fast photodiode
- soldering lab
- optical fibers and attenuators

Testing procedures for the electronics:

- check voltage levels on all powersupplies on the board
- load bitstream to FPGA, verify PCIe communication to PC
- check SPI communication to all parts on the Chip
- init the clock chip, verify ok
